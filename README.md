========
Dotfiles
========

This project is just a collection of dotfiles and scripts for my different GNU/Linux computers.

Installation
============
 - Clone this package in a directory where you will keep it permanently (i.e. ~/dotfiles)
 - Run install.sh
 - Delete any file signaled as already existing that you want to use from this repository and rerun install.sh

TODO
====
 - add git config
 - split .bashrc
 - implement emacs optional packages loading
 - rename .emacs to .myemacs and load it from .emacs
 - store MATE desktop configuration (if doable)
